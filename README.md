# Hey friends ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bilal Khan - aka [ibilalkayy](https://ibilalkayy.com).

- Passionate about Rust, Blockchain, Web, and CLI Applications.
- Make tech videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@coderoamer).

I understand things by creating flashcards or practicing a lot.

I prefer technical books over tutorial videos.
